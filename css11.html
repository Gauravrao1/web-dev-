                Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, 
                
                a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing
                company Stark Industries. When Stark is captured in a war zone and sustains a 
                serious heart wound, he builds his Iron Man armor and escapes his captors. Iron Man's suits of 
                armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character 
                is used to explore political themes, 
                and early Iron Man stories prominently featured Cold War politics. Later stories explored other themes, s
                such as civil unrest, technological advancement
                , corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
